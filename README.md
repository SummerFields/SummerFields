- [Jolicraft] (http://www.jolicraft.com/) - My first source of inspiration!

## Overview

Welcome to the new clean SummerFields repository!  
This version starts from **Minecraft 1.20.2 (pack_format 18)**.  

The previous full history up to version 1.21.1 is preserved under the TODO LINK.

The pack now follows this system:

- **Base:** old version (1.20.2)  
- **Overlays:** progressive updates for newer versions

This approach keeps the repository lightweight while maintaining compatibility with older releases.
